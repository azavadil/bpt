TODO

1. I would like to setup the application to use separate databases or separate collections. 
   The database has a single database with a two collections. Account and Bet. 
   
   The variable we use to access the database is setup in app.js

   $   var models = { Account.require('./models/Account')(config, mongoose, nodemailer)} 

   The application accesses the database with the following syntax

   $   models.Account.xxx

   However, it would be usedful if the Bet collection could be accessed directly. Specifically,
   I'd like to be able to call the .findByIdAndUpdate method directly in the application

   $   models.Bet.findByIdAndUpdate
